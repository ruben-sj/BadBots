Bad Bots

A small student project originally delivered for DATA2410, Spring 2021.
The goal was to build a simple client–server setup where multiple bots connect, send messages, and interact using a lightweight message protocol.

💡 What this project shows

This repository demonstrates foundational understanding of:
• Socket programming
• Simple client/server communication
• Message handling and threading
• Basic handling of malformed or unexpected input

🤖 What the bots actually do

Each bot connects to the server, identifies itself, and reacts to specific inputs.
They also run small scripted behaviours, including a few hidden easter eggs that trigger special responses or coordinated interactions.

The project is intentionally lightweight; the purpose was learning the fundamentals of networked communication rather than building a full application.

🥚 Easter eggs

The code contains a few hidden surprises:
• Certain keywords trigger alternative bot “personalities”
• Some message patterns cause synchronized bot replies
• A couple of small developer jokes buried in the logic

See if you can trigger them all.

📚 Background

This was part of my coursework as a student at OsloMet.
I’ve included it in my portfolio because it shows early work with networking fundamentals and how I approached client/server logic at the time — and because it was genuinely a fun project to build.
